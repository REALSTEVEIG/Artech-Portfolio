# Portfolio Showcase: FastAPI Backend and React Frontend

This is a web portfolio application using FastAPI for the backend and React for the frontend. The application displays a list of projects with individual detail pages.

```

## Backend: FastAPI

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn
- SQLAlchemy (for SQLite integration)

### Setting Up the Backend

1. **Install Dependencies:**

   Navigate to the `backend` directory and install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Backend Server:**

   To start the backend, run the following command from the `backend` directory:

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

   The FastAPI server will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

3. **Seed the Database:**

   To seed the database with sample project data, run the following command:

   ```bash
   python populate_db.py
   ```

   This will clear the existing data and insert new project data.

4. **Available Endpoints:**

   - `GET /projects`: Retrieve a list of all projects.
   - `GET /projects/{id}`: Retrieve details of a specific project by ID.

### Backend Structure

├── main.py           # FastAPI app
├── populate_db.py    # Seeder for project data
├── requirements.txt  # Python dependencies
└── README.md         # Backend instructions
```

## Frontend: React

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 12 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Setting Up the Frontend

1. **Install Dependencies:**

   Navigate to the `frontend` directory and install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the Frontend Development Server:**

   Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The React app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Features

- **Project List:** Displays a list of projects fetched from the backend API.
- **Project Detail:** Individual project detail pages using React Router.
- **Search:** Search functionality to filter projects by title.
- **Responsive Design:** Uses CSS grid and Flexbox for layout and is fully responsive.
- **Animations:** Includes hover effects and transitions.

## Running the Full Application

1. **Start the Backend:**

   First, start the FastAPI backend:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

   The backend will run on `http://localhost:8000`.

2. **Start the Frontend:**

   In a separate terminal, start the React frontend:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

3. **Access the Application:**

   Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. You will see the list of projects and be able to navigate to the project detail pages.

## Optional Enhancements

The following features have been implemented:

- **Search Functionality:** Filter projects by title on the frontend.
- **Project Detail Pages:** Navigate to detailed pages for individual projects using React Router.
- **Backend Data Persistence:** Projects are stored in an SQLite database, with data seeding support.
```

### 4. **Conclusion:**

This project is now fully functional and meets the initial requirements, including:
- FastAPI for the backend with a `/projects` API.
- React frontend that fetches and displays project data.
- Project detail pages with routing.
- Search functionality to filter projects.
- Responsive design with animations and transitions.
